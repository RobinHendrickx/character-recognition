## CO395 Introduction to Machine Learning: Coursework 1 (Decision Trees)

### Introduction

This repository contains the skeleton code and dataset files that you need 
in order to complete the coursework.

### Data

The ``data/`` directory contains the character datasets:

The primary datasets are:
- ``train_full.txt``
- ``train_sub.txt``
- ``train_noisy.txt``
- ``validation.txt``

Some simpler datasets that you may use to help you with implementation or 
debugging:
- ``toy.txt``
- ``simple1.txt``
- ``simple2.txt``

The official test set is ``test.txt``.

### Codes

- ``classification.py``

	* Contains the code ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` class.


- ``eval.py``

	* Contains the code for the ``Evaluator`` class.


- ``main.py``

	* Contains the implementation of the classes in classification.py and eval.py

-  ``pruning.py``
	* Contains the code to prune decision tree
